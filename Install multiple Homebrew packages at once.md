# Install multiple Homebrew packages at once

Before starting, ensure Homebrew is installed correctly by typing `brew`. If it doesn't work, follow their instructions [here](https://brew.sh) (ensure you do the final instructions after running the command!)

1. Open TextEdit, and create a new document

2. Go to `Format` â†’ `Make Plain Text`

3. Add in the syntax after `brew install` in the Formulae, each on a new line (e.g. `brew install --cask utm` becomes `--cask utm` and `brew install macfuse` becomes `macfuse`)

4. Save this as `packages.txt` somewhere (I put it in my Downloads folder)

5. Open Terminal and type `brew install $(cat`, then to avoid having to find the file, drag in your `packages.txt` file. Close this command with a `)` (I used the Downloads folder so my final command looked like this: `brew install $(cat /Users/jamesjingyi/Downloads/packages.txt)`)

6. Let Homebrew do its magic!
